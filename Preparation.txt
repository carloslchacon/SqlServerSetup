*Preparation
*
*This can be anything associated with requesting the server 
*or making sure you have the right Windows settings.
*****************************/
 - The server team has hopefully installed all the latest patches; however, it is always a good idea to double check.
 - Ensure security updates don’t automatically install
 - Install BGINFO – so that when you remote desktop to the server it is clear what server you are on.
BGINFO is a tool that adds system information to your desktop wallpaper so that you have a better understanding of the server you are connected to.
 - Provision Drives
	o Drive for Data files.
	o Drive for Log files
	o Drive for TempDB Files
	o Drive or Network Share for Backups
- Format the drives with 64K allocation blocks for SQL Server databases and log files (including tempdb)
- Ensure the Windows power plan setting is High Performance
- Create service accounts and grant permission to a domain (AD) user, one per SQL Server and agent.
	o Include Perform Volume Maintenance Tasks (if IFI is desired)
- Create Directories.
	o Create directory on the log drive called TransactionLog (i.e. L:\TransactionLog)
	o Create directory on the data drive called SqlData (i.e. G:\SqlData)
- Configure the server firewall
Generally the windows firewall is turned off on a database server.  These are ports you will need to allow.
	o Allow Port 1433
	o Allow Port 1434 (Dedicated Admin Port)
