- Enable database mail
	o Create an operator that points to your support email or your email
	o Configure the SQL Server Alerts properties for Alert System to Enable mail profile, and to use the mail profile that was just configured.
- Remove the local server admins group from the security group
- Configure backups. There are two free options. Ola’s or Minions scripts
- Create job to remove backup history
- Create job to cycle the SQL Server log and the SQL Agent log (we like weekly)
- Larger shops might not need virus scanning software, but plenty of smaller shops still need it because admins use the internet from the server. If you have Anti-virus software, remove the drive where SQL Server data is stored
- Install Monitoring Software of your choice
Ours happens to be the Database Health Monitor (http://DatabaseHealth.com/download)
	o Turn on historic monitoring of waits.
	o Run the Quick Scan report in Database Health Monitor and look for additional issues.
- Create a database owner user and disallow login. Set the database owners to use this login.
